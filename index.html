		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>As someone who has his entire life, lived and being raised abroad, I was given the chance to experience what it was like to grow up in a multicultural environment. This allowed me to grasps intercultural communication at a better understanding which promotes open-mindedness and an overall sensitivity concerning global problematics.  
			<br/><br/> 
			I have always yearned for knowledge, curious in nature, I enjoy talks and discussions regarding multiple topics of activity which directly translates into my willingness to discover and work for different companies specialising in different expertise. But one common aspect that I have found in my past professional experiences, corresponds to the international aspects of the business. This is in fact, the reason why I joined KEDGE.
